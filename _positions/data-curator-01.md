### Premise
- You are a biologist by training. Or a bioinformatician.
- You can write some code. Or you can see yourself learning how.
- Disorganized dishwashers make you cringe.
- You are excited about a non-academic job in an academic setting.
- You know what researchers need and can work with developers to get it built.
- And experience in the realm of clinical genetics is a huge plus.

### Job Description
We are looking for a motivated Data Curator to join the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, for an exciting opportunity in steering how clinical genomics data will be organized, curated, and displayed in a new genomics analysis platform.

Genome sequencing is becoming a routine approach for diagnosing genetic diseases, as well as discovering new disease mechanisms. As the number of patients referred to genetic screening is increasing, there is a clear need to build effective solutions to manage their data for clinical applications. The same data also provides opportunities for research and discovery. 

The Clinical Genomic Analysis Platform (CGAP) at Harvard Medical School is envisioned as a scalable research and clinical web-based application for analysis, annotation, visualization, and reporting of genomic data. CGAP is developed by a multidisciplinary team of clinical geneticists, bioinformatic scientists and software engineers. The working environment combines the best features of a startup (fast pace, flexibility, flat hierarchies) with those of one of the leading medical schools (excellent benefits, outstanding opportunities for learning, great resources, brand recognition).

The Genomics Data Wrangler will be a key member of the team responsible for managing the organization of the CGAP data. The individual will develop, implement, and maintain the CGAP data model, including the clinical information, variants, curation notes, user roles, and other related data. They will participate in the specification, design, and implementation of tools that integrate, search, and display the data, working closely with the bioinformatic scientists and software engineers. The successful candidate must be able to learn and work independently, yet collaborate effectively with co-workers.

### Basic Qualificiations
- PhD in Biology, Bioinformatics, or a related field; Or a Masterâ€™s Degree and 3 years of relevant experience.
- Technical expertise in genetics, molecular biology, bioinformatics or related field.
- Experience with basic computer programming / scripting languages.
- Experience with high-throughput genomics data


### Additional Qualifications
- Working knowledge of Python.
- Research experience involving electronic medical records data, clinical phenotypes, ontologies, or genetic disorders
- Experience in human genetics, cancer genomics, genomic variant calling or interpretation
- Experience with REST APIs, relational databases, software development environments, and version control.
- Project management skills including team management, issue management, and change management.
- Strong verbal and written communication skills.
- Ability to understand scientific literature, experimental procedures and their limitations, and current needs of the research community.
