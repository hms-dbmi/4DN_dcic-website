# Duties & Responsibilities
We are looking for a motivated Imaging Data Scientist to join the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, for an exciting opportunity in steering how cutting-edge imaging data from the [NIH Common Fund 4D Nucleome (4DN) Network](https://commonfund.nih.gov/4Dnucleome/index) will be collected, curated, and displayed.

The Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School is the home to the [4DN Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC)](http://dcic.4dnucleome.org). 4D Nucleome is a $25 million per year NIH Common Fund program aiming to understand the principles behind the three-dimensional organization of the nucleus in space and time, via new mapping and imaging tools. In collaboration with colleagues at the Harvard Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and MIT, the DCIC will design, implement, and maintain an innovative open-source, cloud-based software environment for the management, analysis, and visualization of data generated by the 4D Nucleome Consortium.


The Imaging Data Curator will be a part of the team responsible for creating and managing the metadata necessary to describe the high-throughput data produced by the 4DN consortium. The individual will act as a liaison between the genomics and software expertise at the DCIC and the imaging labs in the 4DN network, and will guide the integration of an existing imaging database management tool (likely OMERO) to the 4DN DCIC database. The individual will participate in the specification, design, and implementation of tools that integrate, search, and display the data, working closely with other data curators, and the software engineering and bioinformatics staff. The successful candidate must be able to learn and work independently, yet collaborate effectively with co-workers.

The Department of Biomedical Informatics is a leading hub for computational biology, translational bioinformatics, and precision medicine. Based on the Harvard Medical School Longwood Campus, the 4D Nucleome DCIC is part of a vibrant community of scientists, physicians, and engineers whose goal is to advance the boundaries of knowledge. The working environment combines the best features of a startup (fast pace, flexibility, flat hierarchies) with those of one of the leading medical schools (excellent benefits, outstanding opportunities for learning, great resources, name recognition).

# Basic Qualificiations
- PhD in Biology, Physics, Bioinformatics, or a related field, or a masterâ€™s degree and 3 years' experience in image data analysis.
- Technical expertise in microscopy, molecular biology, bioinformatics or related field.
- Experience with modern microscopy experiments and their data types.

# Additional Qualifications
- Experience working with OMERO, preferably as a system admin or developer. 
- Experience with REST APIs, relational databases, software development environments, and version control.
- Working knowledge of Python.
- Familiarity with controlled vocabularies and ontologies.  
- Ability to work independently, manage own time and learn quickly.
- Project management skills including team management, issue management, and change management.
- Strong verbal and written communication skills.
- Ability to understand scientific literature, experimental procedures and their limitations, and current needs of the research community.
