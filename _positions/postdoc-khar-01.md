[The Kharchenko Lab](http://pklab.med.harvard.edu) aims to understand the epigenetic mechanisms regulating growth and maintenance of normal tissues, and the extent to which disruptions of the epigenetic state contribute to aging, cancers, and other diseases that distort tissue balance. Within the 4DN DCIC, they are interested in developing novel statistical methods for data integration, especially for single cell level chromatin and image data.
