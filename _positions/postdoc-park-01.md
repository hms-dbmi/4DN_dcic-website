Applications are invited from those with excellent computational genomics training to work in the laboratory of Prof. Peter Park at Harvard Medical School.  The long-term goal of the laboratory is to contribute to our understanding of cancer genetics, neuroscience, and epigenetics through computational analysis of sequencing data. For more information about the lab, please see [compbio.hms.harvard.edu](http://compbio.hms.harvard.edu).

We are part of major new research projects including the 4D Nucleome and the Brain Somatic Mosaicism Network, which will generate a large amount of 3D chromatin and single cell exome/whole-genome data. The successful candidate will join a group of friendly and productive computational biologists in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School and have an opportunity to work with world-class biologists in the Harvard medical area. Recent work from the group includes analysis of massive datasets for biological insights, e.g., Lee et al, Science, 2012; Yang et al, Cell, 2013; Kim et al, Cell, 2013; Davoli et al, Cell, 2013; Ho et al, Nature, 2014; Lodato, Science, 2015.

An ideal candidate will have a Ph.D. in computational biology/bioinformatics/computer science or another quantitative field as well as excellent programming and communication skills. Substantial experience in analysis of high-throughput sequencing data is highly desirable. We are particularly interested in hiring at least one fellow with a rigorous statistical background. Those with an outstanding record in a quantitative field without significant exposure to biology may also be considered.  Exceptional bioinformaticians with interests not specifically mentioned above are also encouraged to apply. 

Please send your CV, a brief statement of research interests, pdfs of your three best papers, and three letters of recommendations to [ peter_park@harvard.edu](mailto:peter_park@harvard.edu).
