### Job Description

We are looking for a motivated Computational Biologist to join the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, for an exciting opportunity in steering how clinical genomics data will be organized, curated, and displayed in a new genomics analysis platform.

Genome sequencing is becoming a routine approach for diagnosing genetic diseases, as well as discovering new disease mechanisms. As the number of patients referred to genetic screening is increasing, there is a clear need to build effective solutions to manage their data for clinical applications. The same data also provides opportunities for research and discovery. 

The Clinical Genomic Analysis Platform (CGAP) at Harvard Medical School is envisioned as a scalable research and clinical web-based application for analysis, annotation, visualization, and reporting of genomic data. CGAP is developed by a multidisciplinary team of clinical geneticists, bioinformatic scientists and software engineers. The working environment combines the best features of a startup (fast pace, flexibility, flat hierarchies) with those of one of the leading medical schools (excellent benefits, outstanding opportunities for learning, great resources, brand recognition).

CGAP is currently seeking a full-time Bioinformatics Scientist to enhance analysis of DNA sequencing data for our growing Genomics Program. The scope of this role will include developing, automating and implementing leading edge genetic software tools, which are essential to annotation of genetic variance of patients with a genetic disease.


### Basic Qualificiations
- PhD in Biology, Bioinformatics, or a related field; Or a Masterâ€™s Degree and 3 years' experience in Bioinformatics.
- Technical expertise in genetics, molecular biology, bioinformatics or related field.
- Strong programming skills, including ability to conceive, implement, and optimize software for large data sets.
- Proficiency in LINUX operating systems and related scripting languages.
- Experience in high performance computing, clusters and cloud computing.
- Proficiency in Python or C/C++.

### Additional Qualifications
- Expertise analyzing next generation sequencing data.
- Experience with software development for healthcare products,
- Familiarity with common clinical scenarios, regulatory and quality standards, payer and provider considerations.
- Experience with REST APIs, relational databases, software development environments, and version control.
