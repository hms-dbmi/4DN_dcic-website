### Premise

You are a DevOps Engineer who wants to
- build open-source infrastructure-as-code solutions for a reliable secure cloud based data processing framework and web platform,
- contribute to healthcare and science,
- work in a small team of developers, scientists, and clinicians, utilizing modern technologies and following best practises, 
- take courses at the Harvard Extension school at very reasonable costs (up to you),
- enjoy other excellent benefits Harvard University has to offer.

### Our Story

Genome sequencing is becoming a routine approach for diagnosing genetic diseases, as well as discovering new disease mechanisms. As the number of patients referred to genetic screening is increasing, there is a clear need to build effective solutions to manage their data for clinical applications and discovery research. 

The Clinical Genomic Analysis Platform (CGAP) at Harvard Medical School is envisioned as a scalable research and clinical web-based application for analysis, annotation, visualization, and reporting of genomic data. CGAP is developed by a multidisciplinary diverse team of clinical geneticists, bioinformatic scientists and software engineers. The working environment combines the best features of a startup (fast pace, flexibility, flat hierarchies) with those of one of the leading medical schools (excellent benefits, outstanding opportunities for learning, great resources, brand recognition).

### Technologies we use (so far)

- AWS (elasticbeanstalk, lambdas, step functions, and many more. And we really need to move to cloudformation.)
- ElasticSearch
- Docker / CWL
- Python / Pyramid
- ReactJS
- Apache / Nginx
- Oauth
- RESTful API
- Git
- Travis / cypress.io / Codacy

### The Job

As a small team, our needs in the devops front range from tuning apache parameters to architecting secure cloud IAM systems for identifiable healthcare data. Compensation commensurate with experience equitably within the Institution.

### Required skills & experience

- Bachelor's' degree in Computer Science or related field.
- 1-5 years of experience working with DevOps methodologies supporting cloud infrastructure (preferably with Amazon Web Services).
- Experience with Python.

### Bonus

- Experience with version control systems and team software development (preferably Git).
- Automated testing, Continuous integration/deployment.
- Strong Python development skills.
- Ability to work independently, manage own time and learn quickly. 
- Ability to define and solve logical problems for highly technical applications.
- Experience with any of ElasticSearch, Docker, Travis, Jenkins, Apache, Nginx or similar.
