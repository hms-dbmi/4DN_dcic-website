Soohyun Lee and Carl Vitzthum have joined the infrastructure team at
DCIC! Soo makes sure 4DN Network data is uniformly and robustly
processed on the AWS cloud environment. This role involves many hats
spanning bioinformatics tool development to coordinating tool
developers to AWS dev-ops. Carl is our new back-end software
developer. It is up to him that the DCIC has a data portal with a
fast responsive searchable database.
