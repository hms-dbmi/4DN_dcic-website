We present [HiGlass](http://higlass.io), a web-based viewer for genome
interaction maps featuring synchronized navigation of multiple views
as well as continuous zooming and panning for navigation across
genomic loci and resolutions.  The manuscript describing HiGlass is now on [bioRxiv](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/31/121889)_
