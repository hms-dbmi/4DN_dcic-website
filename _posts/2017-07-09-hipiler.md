We present an interactive visualization interface - HiPiler - for the
exploration and visualization of regions-of-interest (ROI) in large genome
interaction matrices. HiPiler works on top of HiGlass, and allows
exploring ROIs as snippets. The manuscript describing HiPiler is now on [bioRxiv](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/09/123588).
