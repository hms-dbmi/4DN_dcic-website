Our newest recruit Sarah Reiff has joined the infrastructure team as a
data curator. As we enter the second half of the 5 year 4D Nucleome
Project, the centers of the Network have begun larger scale data
production. Sarah will be part of the team at DCIC responsible for
making sure we collect and curate 4DN data in a timely fashion and
make it available to the public in a most useful format.
