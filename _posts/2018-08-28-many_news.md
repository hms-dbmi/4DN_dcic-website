While the [4DN data portal](https://data.4dnucleome.org) went into
production earlier this year, our team has also been growing. Over the past months Luisa Mercado,
Shannon Ehmsen, and Chad Serrant joined the 4DN DCIC team as Assistant
Data Curator, Graphics Designer, and Senior Software Developer,
respectively.

While we do not have any more openings in the 4DN DCIC infrastructure
team, applications are still invited from those with excellent
computational genomics training to join Park lab in Postdoctoral and
staff scientist positions.
